#  Custom CLI App:



* This is the custom CLI App created as an assignment for LevelZero of neogcamp.
* This app was made using Javascript on repl.it where multiple concepts from basics to intermediate were clogged together and used.
* Chalk was used to add styling to it.The project is very basic but was lot of fun as a beginner to bring up the concepts to real implementation.Thanks to a great teacher like Tanay sir.
